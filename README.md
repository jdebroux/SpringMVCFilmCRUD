## SPRING MVC FILM CRUD

### WEEK 8 TEAM HOMEWORK PROJECT FOR SKILL DISTILLERY

### OVERVIEW
Welcome to MVC Film CRUD.

In this application you will be able to search for a film from the SDVID database either by film ID, or by keyword.  You can also choose to enter a new film to the database.  Once you are viewing a films information, you can choose to edit that films information, or delete the film entirely.  If you choose to edit the film, its current information will show with all fields being pre-populated.  If a user does not enter valid data, error messages are shown before the page actually submits.  If you choose to delete the film from the database, it will just completely remove it from the database.  Each page is loaded with a "Home" button to make navigation easier for the user.

Give the program a test!  This was our first project where we fully implemented full stack development, so there are some stretch goals, but the operations that we did include are completed thoroughly.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
* Spring Tool Suite 4       
* Java
* TOMCAT
* GitHub
* MySQL
* Atom
* Spring Frame Work
* HTML
* JSP
* XML
* Gradle
* C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

### LESSONS LEARNED

It is important to follow a step-by-step procedure when adding code in the controller class, JSP file, and implementation class.
Exact matches must be adhered to when passing data. One character flaw will have the programmers chasing through code eating up valuable time.

Pre-populating the drop-down list in HTML was a challenge with our current languages and was time consuming.
It is a bad idea for multiple people to trouble-shoot the same code at the same time as it creates headaches in resolving pull-push GIT cycle.

Resolving parent/child relationships while updating and deleting database in very important.

We also received familiarization with the pull-push cycle in updating the GIT repository.

Communication among teammates is vital.  Reaching out to other teams to find what problems they encountered, helped prevent following the same rabbit trails and allowed us to better troubleshoot our code.
If Spring wants to auto-fill, let it.  

### STRETCH GOALS

* Work more with HTML and CSS to beautify the page outputs
* Add an actor to the database
* Add an actor to a specific film
* Remove an actor from a film
